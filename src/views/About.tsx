            <p>Hi I'm Issack John I am a fourth-year computer science student at the University of Calgary. I have a
                consistent and hardworking attitude which can be attributed to my approach to difficult problems with a
                road map. I believe this is the most effective way to approach problems, prevent them from becoming
                overwhelming and ensure that you can deal with any issues that arise though the developmental
                process.</p>
