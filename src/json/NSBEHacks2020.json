  "summary": "It started with the black community. Our powerful team wanted to find a gap that we could solve with technology. Historically, black people have not been the leaders in the technology space. Only recently, a strong interest on creating and running your own venture has arisen due to the endless benefits with technology and black people have never been more excited to start their very own start-up venture. We decided to deliver a truly unique experience to individuals that have not really thought the specific details on running a company with specific emphasis on who they can actually make an impact in today's society. To help the aspiring young black tech community bridge the gap, we created the Black Tech Initiative.",
